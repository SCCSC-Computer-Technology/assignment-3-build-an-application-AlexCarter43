I wasn't able to get your application to run. I'm not sure why. I got "There was an error fetching the data from the database". It triggered when the form attempted to load the data grid view and when attempting to fill out the combobox. It was a good idea to include the error messages you have in the Form1. That at least gives us place to look and figure things out if we need to. This left everything in your forms blank for me. I'm not sure if this was somethign on my end, some clash with the access database or what.

Things look ok in your code though. I do wonder if adding ".ToString()" was unnecessary since it looked like all that data should have already been in a string format based on your access table. I would have tested it myself before even bring it up but I currently lack the ability to do so.

The error messages you included with your try/catch statements were a good call. The message confirming the success or reporting the failure of saving was also a smart decision. You might consider nameing your Forms for more clarity. It isn't very important in small projects like this, but VS doesnt' always like changing the form names later so it could be a good habit to get used to doing right away. As our programs expand and collaboration with others increases, having these clearly labeled for function can keep you and others from having to check each form to remember or understand what it does.
