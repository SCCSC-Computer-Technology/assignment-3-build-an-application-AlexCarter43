The code compiles fine with no errors. The datagrid is populated with all 50 rows and all columns on startup.
The code is readable with descriptive names given to controls and methods.
I noticed there are no comments, but given how things are given meaningful names, it not that big of a deal; plus I am guilty of it too.
There is not any sorting, filtering, updating, or searching built in yet, except what is native to the dataGrid.
I like that the state details come up immediately when selected in the comboBox instead of having to hit another button. Makes it more intuitive.
I wish I had also done my state info form with populated fields like you did.
Good job giving the connectionString a generic reference that works on other people's machines.
I saw that a couple of people explicitely named their local file structure, which throws errors on other machines.
I like your implementation of the state info screen over mine. Your's looks better with populated labels and fields.
I opted to just show another datagrid with only the selected state showing, which is pretty boring.
I think from what you have already, you could easily implement some more buttons for advanced searching/filtering.
